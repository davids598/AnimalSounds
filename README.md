## Intro
This is an app that I built while working through the _AP Computer Science Principles with Swift_ book written by Apple Inc. 
You can find the book [here](https://books.apple.com/us/book/ap-computer-science-principles-with-swift/id1456795905). However, you can only download and read it if 
you have an Apple device. 
The book is simply the AP course but in the Swift language and Xcode. I went through this book over the summer before my freshman fall courses at UCR as
a way to prepare and review for future CS classes, and to prepare me for the next book I planned to read, [App Development With Swift](https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996).      

## AnimalSounds
In this app I learned how to:    
- Work with classes built by Apple (SimpleSound)
- Work with audio

The app displays three emojis of animals, that when clicked, play a sound that relates to the animal.
